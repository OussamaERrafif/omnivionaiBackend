## 5. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Web Search Fails

**Symptoms**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Web search error: [error message]
‚ö†Ô∏è No web results, using fallback analysis
```

**Solution**: 
- Network connectivity issue
- DDGS rate limiting
- System still works with fallback
- Search terms will be generated without web context

---

### Issue: Structure Missing

**Symptoms**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Some structural elements may be missing (Abstract: False, ...)
```

**Possible Causes**:
- LLM didn't follow instructions
- Response was truncated
- Insufficient source material

**Solution**:
- Check LLM configuration (model, temperature)
- Verify sufficient sources were found
- May need to adjust prompt or increase max tokens

---

### Issue: Short Output

**Symptoms**: Paper is too short (<1000 words)

**Possible Causes**:
- Few sources found
- LLM response truncated
- Max tokens set too low

**Solution**:
- Check number of sources found
- Increase max_tokens in config
- Verify research agent found quality sources

## 6. API Testing with Frontend

### Start Both Services

Terminal 1:
```powershell
cd backend
python api.py
```

Terminal 2:
```powershell
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

### Test Through UI

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Enter a research query
3. Watch the progress indicators:
   - Query validation
   - **Web search and analysis** (new!)
   - Research progress
   - Summarization
   - Verification
   - **PhD-grade synthesis** (enhanced!)
   - Formatting

4. Review the output:
   - Should see complete paper structure
   - Abstract, Introduction, Chapters, Discussion, Conclusion
   - Extensive citations
   - Professional formatting

---

## 7. Performance Metrics

### Expected Timings

- Query Validation: 1-2 seconds
- **Web Search**: 3-5 seconds (new!)
- Query Analysis: 3-5 seconds
- Research: 20-60 seconds (depends on iterations)
- Summarization: 10-20 seconds
- Verification: 10-20 seconds
- **PhD Synthesis**: 30-90 seconds (enhanced - longer due to comprehensive output)
- Formatting: 1-2 seconds

**Total**: 80-200 seconds (varies by query complexity and source availability)

### Quality Metrics

- **Search Term Relevance**: Should be >80% relevant to web results
- **Source Quality**: Average confidence score >0.6
- **Citation Density**: At least 1 citation per 2-3 sentences
- **Structure Completeness**: All 5 main sections present
- **Word Count**: 2000-5000 words typical
- **Academic Quality**: Publication-ready

---

## 8. Debugging Tips

### Enable Verbose Logging

In `api.py` or orchestrator, add print statements:

```python
print(f"DEBUG: Web results: {web_results}")
print(f"DEBUG: Generated questions: {search_terms}")
print(f"DEBUG: Paper length: {len(answer)} characters")
```

### Check Individual Agents

Test each agent separately:

```python
# Test Query Analyzer with Web Search
analyzer = QueryAnalyzerAgent()
result = await analyzer.process("quantum computing")
print(result)

# Test Reasoning Agent
reasoning = ReasoningAgent()
paper = await reasoning.process(query, summaries)
print(paper)
```

### Verify Dependencies

```powershell
cd backend
pip list | grep -E "(langchain|ddgs|fastapi)"
```

Should show:
- langchain
- langchain-openai
- duckduckgo-search (ddgs)
- fastapi
- uvicorn
