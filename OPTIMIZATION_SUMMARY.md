## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### 1. Normal Usage (No Changes Required)

All optimizations are applied automatically. Your existing code works without modification:

```python
from agents.orchestrator import Orchestrator

orchestrator = Orchestrator()
result = await orchestrator.search("Your query", search_mode="deep")
```

### 2. Performance Testing

```bash
# Quick performance check
cd backend
python test_performance.py
# Select option 4 for quick test

# Full benchmark
python test_performance.py
# Select option 2 for comprehensive benchmarks
```

### 3. Configuration Tuning (Optional)

Adjust concurrency in `config.py` if needed:

```python
# For high-performance servers
MAX_CONCURRENT_SCRAPING = 12
MAX_CONCURRENT_LLM_CALLS = 15

# For resource-constrained environments  
MAX_CONCURRENT_SCRAPING = 4
MAX_CONCURRENT_LLM_CALLS = 5
```
